# Neighborhood Project

This project is the final project for the Udacity Front End Nanodegree, an interactive Neighborhood Map programmed with React. I lived half a year during my studies in
Lyon, France. I loved this city and I had a wonderful time there. I hope you'll also like to explore this beautiful city!


## Installation and Running the Project

To install and use the project:

* **Zip-Download:** Download the repository as a zip-file, extract it, use Git Bash to change
into the project directory.
* **Clone the Repository:** Clone the repository with Git Bash to a directory of your choice: ```git clone https://github.com/DanielaKuester/Udacity-Project07-MyReadsApp/```.
* install all project dependencies with `npm install`
* start the development server with `npm start`
* ater running `npm start`, the React App should open automatically in your browser. If it doesn't, open `localhost:3000` in your Browser.
* **Service-Workers** only work in build-mode, not in the dev-mode. Run `npm run build` to build the app.


## Future Updates
* I'm planning to find another way of error handling. At the moment, my workaround with the text on the background must be enough.
* I also want to add photos and links to more information about the places, as well as my personal experiences with the shown places.


## Dependencies

* The map is provided by [Mapbox-GL-JS API](https://www.mapbox.com/mapbox-gl-js/api)
* The data for the markers and popups comes from the [Foursquare API](https://developer.foursquare.com/)

## Credits

* The [Udacity React lessons about controlled components](https://classroom.udacity.com/nanodegrees/nd001/parts/c3e7b0d6-ffef-4421-b5fc-6df10fd0a1ae/modules/82766b2b-1870-4904-aa90-8ccbe63928c5/lessons/14331e60-a548-4cfb-a326-054545da8927/concepts/fc3f11d3-8779-4d8a-8a23-1cd782f8ddf3) helped me to implement the basic version of the search function. One of my fellow FEND students, Bartek Burkot, helped me with troubleshooting when my marker filter didn't work.
* [Yayha Elharony's tutorials](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ywdxLNjhBYw&list=PLgOB68PvvmWCGNn8UMTpcfQEiITzxEEA1) helped me to set up my project with a combination of vanilla JavaScript and React.
* Bram Vanroy helped me to connect the markers with the sidebar buttons. The use of data attributes was a true revelation to me.
* Alain Cadenat, Cedric Fontaine, Bartek Burkot and Eman Zaghloul helped me with troubleshooting and gave me valuable tips for better debugging.
* My family, friends, pets and everyone around me supported me a lot during this journey.
* The turtle squad gave me the power to go on when I thought that I couldn't make it any more.
* Big thanks to the Udacity team for all their positivity and support!


## Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app). You can find more information on how to perform common tasks [here](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md).

## Contributing

This repository is my project as a Udacity student. I am planning to work on the project and to update it in the future to document how my programming skills grow and develop. Therefore, I most likely will not accept pull requests.
